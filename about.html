      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Recent graduate from Rochester Institute of Technology with an MS in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Robotics and AI.
      </p> <p>
        I am passionate about leveraging advanced robotics and AI technologies to solve real-world problems. During my studies, I focused on robot kinematics, perception, and machine learning. I was also an active member of several professional organizations, including RIT's Electric Vehicle Team and Rovers Team. Through these experiences, I have developed a strong foundation in electrical engineering, C/C++, Python, machine learning, and mechanical robotic design.
      </p> <p></p>
        I am currently seeking a research engineering position where I can contribute to innovative projects in the field of robotics. I am eager to collaborate with a dynamic team to push the boundaries of what's possible and drive advancements in this exciting field.
