        <p>
          I’m an engineer focused on designing robust robotic systems across embedded hardware, motion control, and electromechanical integration. My academic work at RIT emphasized robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, supported by hands-on experience in multidisciplinary teams.
        
        </p>
        <p>
          At RIT, I contributed to the
          <a href="https://rit-evt.com/"  target="_blank" class="blue-link">Electric Vehicle Team</a> and the University Rover Challenge Team, building a strong foundation in C/C++, PCB design, Python, and system-level robotics development.
        </p>

          I’m currently a Research Engineer II at the           
          <a href="https://rad.engr.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" class="blue-link">Robotics and Automation Design Lab</a> 
          at Texas A&M University, where I support hardware and software development for robotic manipulators intended for use in spaceflight and mission-critical environments.
